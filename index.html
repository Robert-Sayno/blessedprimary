                KISORO.</h3>
            <p>Education is for self-reliance, so we should all strive for it. It is only through
                Education that development will be achieved. Bunagana Town Council is a small
                Town in Kisoro District in South Western Uganda bordering Democratic Republic
                of Congo (D.R.C) and Rwanda. It is about 500 km from Kampala the Capital City
                of Uganda. Bunagana Town Council is small and densely populated. It has an area
                of 10 square kilometers and population of 10,478 as per Census of 2013 making
                1047.8 per square Kilometer. Today the population is over 28,000 people.
                Many people have problems among which poverty is the major one. The only
                solution to problems is education and without it, there is little hope for the future.
                The only lasting solution to the peoples' problems is to put Education in the first
                place. Due to this problem, when old people die, they leave their young ones
                suffering more without any thing;.</p>
